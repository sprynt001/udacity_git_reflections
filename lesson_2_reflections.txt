What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Answer (Monday 11 May 2015)
    When you initialise a repository git creates a hidden directory containing metadata about all the files in the repository. The contents of this directory are updated on each commit as files are added removed and changed.

    Initialisation is needed to create the repository and let git know that it needs to start tracking the contents of the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area holds files that will be committed in the next commit. It therefore contains a subset of files in the working directory and the changes in the files in the staging area have not yet been saved to the repository.

The advantage of having a staging area is that we can ensure we have all the things we want to commit before making the commit. If necessary we can add and remove from it without making our repository log messy.

It seems that it is the version of the file that is put in the staging area that will be committed. i.e. if the file is changed after it is added to the staging area, it is the version from the staging area that will be committed!
